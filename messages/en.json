        "question": "Can I use my SIM alongside the ViajareSIM eSIM?",
        "answer": "Yes, select the physical SIM for phone calls and SMS, and use the ViajareSIM eSIM for mobile data on your device. Keep in mind that if you keep the SIM active, your carrier may apply roaming charges when making or receiving calls and sending or receiving text messages."

      {
        "category": "Recharge",
        "question": "What happens if I use all my data or my eSIM expires?",
        "answer": "All eSIMs have a maximum data usage limit and a limited duration in days. If you use all your data before the plan period ends, the eSIM will stop working, and you'll lose internet access. Similarly, once the days stipulated in the plan have passed, the eSIM will deactivate. If you need more data than your eSIM offers, the best option is to recharge it with the amount of data that best suits your needs, ensuring you don’t run out of connection when you need it most."

        "category": "Support",
        "question": "Is my device unlocked for eSIM use?",
        "answer": "Only unlocked mobile phones can use eSIM. Make sure your device is unlocked before purchasing from the ViajareSIM store. To clarify any doubts, we explain it in detail. What does it mean to have an 'unlocked phone'? Mobile phones rely on a carrier to make calls and connect to mobile data. Carriers allow your device to connect to their network. If your phone is unlocked, it can connect to any carrier's network. If your phone is locked, based on the contract, you can only use the network of a specific carrier. Therefore, if you insert a new SIM or eSIM, it won’t work. How to check if your phone is unlocked There are 4 methods: Where did you buy your phone? If you purchased your device directly from the manufacturer's store (such as Apple or Samsung), it is most likely unlocked. However, if you bought it through a telecommunications provider (like Orange, AT&T, or Movistar), it may be locked to that provider, preventing you from using an eSIM. Try with another SIM The simplest way to check if your phone is unlocked is to borrow a SIM card from a friend or family member. If you can use that SIM to make calls or send messages on your device, your phone is unlocked. If you can’t make calls or send SMS with the new SIM, your phone is locked and cannot use an eSIM. Check in the settings (for iPhone only) The following steps work with iOS 14 and later versions: Go to 'Settings'. Scroll down and select 'General'. Go to the 'About' section. Scroll down and look for 'Carrier Lock' or 'Network Provider Lock'. If it says 'No SIM restrictions', it means your iPhone is unlocked and can use an eSIM. Otherwise, your iPhone is locked to a specific carrier. Contact your provider As a last option, you can contact your service provider. They can tell you if your phone is unlocked or locked to their network. They can also assist you in unlocking your device. My phone is unlocked. Can I use an eSIM? In addition to being unlocked, your device must be compatible with eSIM. You can check if your device is compatible by consulting our updated list."

        "answer": "If you've lost or mistakenly deleted the QR code, contact us by sending an email to contacto@viajaresim.com or through chat, and we'll resend the code.

        "question": "My QR code isn't working, what can I do?",
        "answer": "There are several reasons you might have trouble scanning the QR code. We've created a checklist to help you identify the problem easily: Are you connected to a WiFi network? You can't install an eSIM without being connected to a WiFi network. If you don’t have a WiFi connection, the QR code won’t scan correctly. It’s recommended to install the eSIM at home before traveling to ensure a stable WiFi connection. Important: scan the code to install the eSIM, but don’t activate data roaming until you reach your destination. Is your phone compatible with eSIM? If you've already verified that your phone is compatible, proceed to the next point. If you're unsure, check our updated list to see if your model is compatible. In addition to compatibility, make sure your device is unlocked. Is your phone not compatible? Contact us, and we'll find a solution. Have you already scanned the eSIM QR code? Remember that an eSIM QR code can only be scanned once. If you try to scan it again, you might see a message saying: 'Data plan can't be added.' It's possible that the eSIM is already installed on your phone. Check the SIM manager or your device's settings to see if it's present. If it’s not installed, contact us via our website. Are you scanning from your phone's settings menu? You can't scan the QR code directly from your phone's camera. You must access the settings menu and follow the appropriate process to scan the eSIM. If you need help setting up an eSIM, check the specific guide for your device: Set up an eSIM on iPhone Set up an eSIM on Samsung Set up an eSIM on Google Pixel Try setting up the eSIM manually If the QR code still won't scan, there may be an issue with your phone's camera. Every eSIM has a reference number that you can use to activate it manually. At ViajareSIM, we send you this reference number in the same email as the QR code. When scanning the code, select 'Enter data manually' and input the provided information for manual installation. Is your eSIM QR code still not working? If you've tried all the previous methods and still can't scan the QR code, contact us via chat. Our customer support team is available 24/7 and will surely help you resolve it."

        "question": "How do I uninstall an eSIM on iPhone?",
        "answer": "Once you've used the eSIM and the data plan has ended, it's time to remove it from your device. Before doing so, consider the following: Removing the eSIM from your iPhone doesn’t cancel the contract or plan you have. By removing it, you're simply deleting the profile you installed on your phone. Make sure you really need to remove the eSIM profile on your iPhone. For security reasons, most eSIM providers only allow the installation method to be used once. If you're sure you want to delete your eSIM, follow these steps: Go to Settings > Mobile Data. Select the data plan you want to delete. Tap 'Delete Mobile Plan' to complete the process. And that's it!"
